			<h3 style="color:white;">Bugs</h3>
			<span class="text-white-50 text">Here is a list of known bugs, and areas where certain functionalities aren't working as intended
				<uL>
					<li>Adding company association doesn't always work</li>
					<li>On the other side, for corporate users they can't always see the individual users linked to them</li>
					<li>Not all of the old graphs work</li>
					<li>Some parts of the dashboard such as certain graphs aren't responsive </li>
					<li>Sometimes, even if the user is logged out, the main dashboard is still visible</li>

			<h3 style="color:white;">Critical evaluation of the project</h3>
			<span class="text-white-50 text"><br>

					<h5 style="color:white;">User Interface & User Experience</h5>
						Although the user interface and experience is fairly simple and minimalistic, it does achieve what it needs to do and we have 
						put a fair amount of work into making the login page, registeration page and the visualisations look nicer compared to what they looked like.
						<br><br>Moreover, most of the user cases are somewhat similar to what you might find in a regular dashboard and thus it is highly likely that 
						the user experience would be smooth. Finally, a significant point to note is that our requirements were mostly concerned 
						with the backend of the web application rather than the front-end<br><br>
						
					<h5 style="color:white;">Functionality</h5>
					This part was the most challenging one as we had to make sure that the previos version of fhir fli still works in addition to 
					what we add to it. We did try our best to achieve that, however there were a lot of bugs introduced when attempting to add 
					new functionalities, we did fix most of them, but some still remain, mainly on the corporate side.<br><br>

					<h5 style="color:white;">Stability</h5>
					The project was developed using very popular and stable JavaScript libraries, and this was noted during our research and 
					affected our choices. And thus it the stability of the project is fairly good. Also, future developers will be able to find 
					a wide range of resources and tutorials about the technologies used in developing this project which will keep this project 
					alive for a long while as it is open-source.<br><br>

					<h5 style="color:white;">Efficiency</h5>
					As mentioned in our Design section, we have done a lot of refactoring and thought a lot about our design decisions to make 
					generating the visualisations as smooth and efficient as possible (as this project doesn't have any particular algorithms) and thus 
					the efficiency section is concerned with the front-end which is basically using React, Redux and Victory to manipulte the DOM.<br><br>

					<h5 style="color:white;">Compatability</h5>
					The project was fairly tested (as in the Testing section) on several distinct platforms including but not limited to Firefox,
					Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, and Safari and was found to be working as expected. However, regarding on mobile phones and tablets it wasn't as 
					thoroughly tested. <br><br>
					Web browser compatibility was less of a priority for this project. Furthermore, as the practical usecase of the system would be for an internal visualization tool for the Client's company, the range of expected browser types would be significantly smaller - i.e for security reasons, company users would not be using older versions of Internet Explorer, as it has numerous vulnerabilities.
Thus,test were only performed recent browser versions (< 1 year since last update) and only tested desktop based screen resolutions. 
					<br><br>

					<h5 style="color:white;">Maintainability</h5>
					This was one of the most significant parts when developing FHiR FLI 2.0 as we took this project over from someone else and we 
					knew that someone else is going to take it over from us and thus there are a wide range of explanations that can be found on this 
					website to help future developers understand the current codebase. We also made sure to comment and document every part of the 
					code that we have written ourselves just that future developers wouldn't struggle too much to understand it and build upon it.<br><br>

					<h5 style="color:white;">Project Management</h5>
					After our first month, we started setting milestones and deadlines for finishing the tasks (which can be found in the Gantt chart below)
					There were a good amount of tasks to do ranging from HCI diagrams, reports, presentations to technical ones and thus we had to make sure 
					that those tasks were spread out across the span of 5 months and not quickly rushed through in the last month. Certainly, the bi-weekly reports 
					and the weekly progress check on both the labs and the term one did help keep us on track.

				<h3 style="color:white;">Future Work</h3>
				<span class="text-white-50 text">This section is about features that we wanted to implement but didn't have enough 
					to implement due to time constraints, however, for future developers it is fairly easy to start where we stopped.<br><br>
					<ul>
						<li>Improve the design of the user's dashboard, this is due to the fact that the current design is fairly minimalistic
							and doesn't adhere to modern data visualisations dashboards, we worked on this by improving the login and registeration
							page, but we didn't improve the user's dashboard.
						</li><br><br>
						<li>
							Improve the decentralised data storage system, this was one of our most challenging requirements, at the beginning 
							we attempted the implementation of Solid inrupt (can be found here <a href="https://solid.inrupt.com ">Solid Inrupt</a>)
							but we couldn't finish certain parts due to lacking documentation and support, however, there are a lot of useful information
							that will certainly help that can be found on our Research tab, also here is a general outline of what needs to be done 
							<ol>
								<li>Implement solid-auth which is a JS browser library that allows users to authenticate access to their Solid PODS,
									this can be found here <a href="https://github.com/solid/solid-auth-client">solid-auth</a>
								</li>
								<li>After doing that, integrate the rdflib NodeJS library on the backend, this can be found here 
									<a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/rdflib">rdlib</a>, this is based on manipulating linked data which is the 
									essential foundation of Solid inrupt, this is the part where the actual writing data process is done to the users 
									Solid Pods
								</li>
							</ol>
						</li><br><br>

						<li>Design more distinct graphs for representing the Fitbit data, the best library for doing this is 
							<a href="https://formidable.com/open-source/victory/">Victory JS</a>, you will find that our codebase is
						designed to facilitate the use of this library. </li><br><br>

						<li>Integrate the goals system with the Fitbit data</li>

					</ul>
