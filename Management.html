					<h6 class="text-white mb-4">Potential liabilities</h6>
					
						<ol class="text-white-50">
							<li class="text-white-50">The inaccuracy or incorrectness of data</li><br>
								<span>The software product is responsible for managing and displaying the input health data as
										visualizations. However, there might be some cases that the data gets incorrectly displayed or
										inaccurately due to bugs or rounding values at some situations.</span><br><br>

							<li class="text-white-50">The loss of the data</li><br>
								<span>It is possible that the health data of the user
										gets lost due to possible events such as hard drive failure. Moreover, another possible situation
										would be that the data gets leaked in an event as an adversary getting access to the users’
										private health data.</span><br><br>
						</ol>

						<h6 class="text-white mb-4">Data privacy considerations</h6>

							<span style="color:grey">
									This product is mainly concerned with managing and representing data and therefore this
									subject is very crucial to its sustainability and offering it’s users reassurance that their data is
									private and secure enough. <br><br>
									A user registration system has been developed such that every user
									can have private access to his data and it can’t be seen by anyone else unless this user gives
									them his credentials.It is also significant that when users attempt to input their health data
									through their smart watches (Fitbit), the software product is to ask them for consent to use their
									data, it also gives them a detailed list of the data it is going to access and they can select any
									kind of data that they don’t wish to share and thus increasing their privacy as much as possible.<br><br>

									To furthermore boost users’ privacy and provide them with reassurance about the safety of their
									data, my team and I will develop a decentralized data storage system such that the data is not
									controlled or under the possession of a single entity.In addition to that, security measures have
									been put into place when storing some of the users’ data such as passwords making it much
									more difficult for adversaries to acquire users’ data which enhances the data privacy.
							</span><br><br>

						<h6 class="text-white mb-4">License type</h6>

						<span style="color:grey">
								Regarding the license type of the software product, the work that team number 18 is doing is the
								extension of an already existing software product and so, we had to have the same type of
								license that the software product that we are building on has which is the MIT license, this
								license allows commercial use, distribution, modification and private use, however, it doesn't
								provide a warranty and it states that the company releasing the software product will not be held
								responsible regarding any potential liabilities.

				<h3 class="text-white mb-4">User manual</h3>
						<span class="text-white-50">This part is a very brief guide on how to use FHIR FLI 2.0, it will also explain the components
							of the web application and how they can be used

							<ol>
								<li></li>
							</ol>
						</span><br><br>

				<h3 class="text-white mb-4">Deployment manual</h3>
					<span class="text-white-50">A very important part of this project was to make this project easy for future
					developers to set up and get started to work with as fast as possible, that is why we made sure that our code
				is properly commented and documented, and also we had Docker containers set up for making deployment much more
			quicker. Thus, there are 2 options for deployment that will be explained.<br><br>
						
			<ol>
				<li>The first one is deployment through NodeJS and the command line.</li><br>
					<span class="text-white-50">
						Several libraries and frameworks must be download first (Pre-requisites):<br><br>
						<ol>
							<li>Install NodeJS here <a target="_blank" href="https://nodejs.org/en/download/" >NodeJS Download</a></li>
							<li>Clone the github repository using git clone <a href="https://github.com/faneggy/fhirfli">Github FHIR FLI 2.0 </a></li>
							<li>Navigate to the repository using the command line and type <strong> npm install</strong> to install the required packages</li>
							<li>Download MongoDB here <a href="https://www.mongodb.com">MongoDB</a></li>
							<li>Install Java JDK here <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/webnotes/install/windows/jdk-installation-windows.html">Java</a></li>
							<li>Download and extract Apache Drill to /opt/drill/ , Apache Drill can be found at <a href="https://drill.apache.org/download/">Apache Drill</a></li>
						</ol><br>
						After that there are 2 options: <br><br>
						A. either starting the NodeJS server: <br><br>
						<ol>
							<li>Run mongod on the terminal to start the mongodb server</li>
							<li>Navigate to the project directory on the terminal and type <strong>node populate_db.js</strong>to setup the Databse</li>
							<li>run the script runit.sh on the terminal that sets the environment variables and starts the server</li>
						</ol><br>
						B. Deployment through Docker<br><br>
						
						<ol>
							<li>Install Docker here <a href="https://www.docker.com">Docker</a></li>
							<li>Start Docker on your machine</li>
							<li>Before starting there is some configuration that is required</li>
								<ul>
									<li>Go to the secrets.env file inside the fhirfli file and change and add the docker container's name here<br>
										( MONGODB_LOCAL=mongodb://(container name):27017/ )
									</li>
									<li>Navigate to drill/Dockerfile and make sure the apache drill link is up to date</li>
								</ul>
								<li>Navigate to the project directory and type <strong>docker-compose up</strong> on the terminal</li>
						</ol>
					</span>
			</ol>

				<h3 class="text-white mb-4">Gantt chart</h3>
					<span class="text-white-50">Definitely, due to the fact that we were asked to do many tasks simulataneously
					managing this project was challenging. And as a result, a gantt chart was significant to make sure we had several
				distinct milestones spanning across a period of 28 weeks.</span>
