							<li class="text-white-50">The inaccuracy or incorrectness of data</li><br>
								<span>The software product is responsible for managing and displaying the input health data as
										visualizations. However, there might be some cases that the data gets incorrectly displayed or
										inaccurately due to bugs or rounding values at some situations.</span><br><br>

							<li class="text-white-50">The loss of the data</li><br>
								<span>It is possible that the health data of the user
										gets lost due to possible events such as hard drive failure. Moreover, another possible situation
										would be that the data gets leaked in an event as an adversary getting access to the users’
										private health data.</span><br><br>
						</ol>

						<h6 class="text-white mb-4">Data privacy considerations</h6>

							<span style="color:grey">
									This product is mainly concerned with managing and representing data and therefore this
									subject is very crucial to its sustainability and offering it’s users reassurance that their data is
									private and secure enough. <br><br>
									A user registration system has been developed such that every user
									can have private access to his data and it can’t be seen by anyone else unless this user gives
									them his credentials.It is also significant that when users attempt to input their health data
									through their smart watches (Fitbit), the software product is to ask them for consent to use their
									data, it also gives them a detailed list of the data it is going to access and they can select any
									kind of data that they don’t wish to share and thus increasing their privacy as much as possible.<br><br>

									To furthermore boost users’ privacy and provide them with reassurance about the safety of their
									data, my team and I will develop a decentralized data storage system such that the data is not
									controlled or under the possession of a single entity.In addition to that, security measures have
									been put into place when storing some of the users’ data such as passwords making it much
									more difficult for adversaries to acquire users’ data which enhances the data privacy.

						<h6 class="text-white mb-4">License type</h6>

						<span style="color:grey">
								Regarding the license type of the software product, the work that team number 18 is doing is the
								extension of an already existing software product and so, we had to have the same type of
								license that the software product that we are building on has which is the MIT license, this
								license allows commercial use, distribution, modification and private use, however, it doesn't
								provide a warranty and it states that the company releasing the software product will not be held
								responsible regarding any potential liabilities.
